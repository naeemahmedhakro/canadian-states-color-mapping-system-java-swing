# canadian-states-color-mapping-system-java-swing
A java swing application that uses user input to decide the root states to start coloring from and respectively color differently to the connected states
This system follows constraints satisfaction problem using Breadth-First-Search algorithm to traverse the nodes(States) of graph(map)
System first ask for color domain in which minimum of 3 colors should be selected by user
Then it assigns the colors to the states in such order that no connected state have same color form the domain
